// Backbone.SubRoute extends the functionality of Backbone.Router such that each of an application's modules
// can define its own module-specific routes.  This eliminates the need for one monolithic Router configuration,
// The base router can instead act as a simple delegator that forwards module-specific routes to the
// appropriate module-specific SubRoute.
//
// For example, given this URL:
//   http://example.org/myModule/foo/bar
//
// ...the base router would be responsible for invoking and delegating to the proper module based on "myModule".
// The module would then have its own SubRoute which would have its own mappings for the foo/bar part.
//
// This project is based on a Gist by Tim Branyan: https://gist.github.com/1235317
