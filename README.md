#Backbone Subroute

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ModelN/backbone.subroute.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ModelN/backbone.subroute)

##About

Backbone's Router feature is really powerful, but for large multi-module apps, it can quickly become large and unmaintainable.  

Backbone.SubRoute extends the functionality of Backbone.Router such that each of an application's modules
can define its own module-specific routes.  This eliminates the need for one monolithic Router configuration,
The base router can instead act as a simple delegator that forwards module-specific routes to the
appropriate module-specific SubRoute.

For example, given this URL:
  http:example.org/myModule/foo/bar

...the base router would be responsible for invoking and delegating to the proper module based on "myModule".
The module would then have its own SubRoute which would have its own mappings for the foo/bar part.

This project is based on [a Gist by Tim Branyen](https://gist.github.com/1235317), and [used with permission](https://gist.github.com/1235317/74bf2745515d902e0bfc87bd8e95e94c93362915#gistcomment-234230) from the original author.

Subroute is lightweight, weighing in at under 300 bytes minified and gzipped.

## Get Involved!

### Mailing List

Join the [Backbone.Subroute Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/backbone-subroute) to discuss new features and stay-up-to-date on project updates.

### Ways to Contribute

Has Subroute been helpful to you?  If you'd like to give back, here are a few ways:

1. Blog about your experiences using Subroute, and let us know about it!
2. Create a demo app using Subroute and add it to the repo.
3. Improve the docs in the README.  
4. Fix a bug or add a new feature and submit a pull request (see below)

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome.  For any significant change or new feature, please start a discussion in the Google Group, or log an issue first.  This will save you some time, in case your idea is deemed not general enough to be included in the project.

Before submitting a pull request, please:

1. Write unit tests to cover any new or modified lines of code, and add it to the `specs/` directory.  See the [Testing](#testing) section for more info.
2. Run the test specs to make sure everything works.  You can fire up a local web server, and point your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/spec/`
3. Run the Grunt task to lint, test, and run code coverage on the project.  See the [Build](#build) section for more info.

## Build

### Grunt

Subroute uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to verify each build.  If you are not familiar with Grunt, check out the [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) for an introduction and installation instructions.

Before submitting a pull request, please run the grunt task.  To do so:

First, install local development dependencies.  From the root Subroute directory, run:

```
npm install
```

then

```
grunt
```

The task will do 4 things:

### Uglify
The code will be minified and saved to `dist/backbone.subroute.min.js`.

### Lint
Javascript files are checked for errors using [JSHint](http://jshint.com/).  The JSLint configuration is driven by the `.jshintrc` file.

### Test
Test specs are run headlessly using [PhantomJS](www.phantomjs.org)

### Coverage
Code coverage is enforced using [Istanbul](http://istanbul-js.org/).  Currently not every feature of Subroute has coverage.  
But the enforced coverage levels are set such that code coverage cannot decrease.  Over time, more tests will be added to increase coverage
to as close to 100% as possible (help with this is greatly appreciated!)

### Travis-CI

The Grunt build is run automatically using [Travis-CI](travis-ci.org) upon every pull request and push to master.  But if any errors are found, you'll need to fix them and re-submit your pull request.  So please run the grunt task locally to save time.



### Defining a SubRouter
Let's say that you've got a section of your web app multiple pieces of functionality all live under the URL prefix `http://yourserver.org/books`.  Here's how you'd create your subrouter.  

```
var BooksRouter = Backbone.SubRoute.extend({
    routes: {
        ""               : "showBookstoreHomepage", 
        "search"         : "searchBooks",           
        "view/:bookId"   : "viewBookDetail",        
    },
    showBookstoreHomepage: function() {
        // ...module-specific code
    },
    searchBooks: function() {
        // ...module-specific code
    },
    viewBookDetail: function(bookId) {
        // ...module-specific code using bookId param
    }
});
```
Note that the subrouter, itself, doesn't know or care what its prefix is.  The prefix is only provided when instantiating specific instances of the sub-router.  This makes sub-routers especially useful for reusing common pieces of code.

### Creating an Instance

To use your sub-router, siply call its constructor and provide a prefix, like so:

```
var mySubRouteInstance = new BooksRouter("books");
```

### Understanding The Magic

Given the example above, with an instance of the sub-route being created with the `"books"` argument passed as a constructor, and deployed on a server with a base URL of `yourserver.org`, this results in the following routes being created:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Subroute</th><th>Expands To</th><th>Matches URL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>""</td><td>books</td><td>http://yourserver.org/books</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"search"</td><td>books/search</td><td>http://yourserver.org/books/search</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"view/:bookId"</td><td>books/view/:bookId</td><td>http://yourserver.org/books/view/1234</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Passing Parameters to SubRouter Instances

When instantiating a SubRouter, you may wish to provide some parameters from the calling code, which may be needed in your sub-router code.  The sub-router constructor takes an optional object literal as a second argument.

For instance:

```
var mySubRouteInstance = new BooksRouter("books", {locale: "en_US", isVIP: true));
```

Then in your sub-router definition, you can access these parameters using the familiar Backbone `options` object, used in other Backbone components.  Like so:

```
initialize: function(options) {
    this.locale = options.locale;
    this.isVIP = options.isVIP;
}

```
Thanks to [@carpeliam](https://github.com/ModelN/backbone.subroute/pull/2) for this feature.

### Trailing Slashes

Backbone treats routes with trailing slashes as totally different routes than those without.  For instance, these are two different routes in Backbone:

`"search"`

`"search/"`

URL semantics aside, [many people have found this behavior annoying](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/848).  If you're one of them, and you want to support either format without duplicating each and every one of your routes, you can pass the optional `createTrailingSlashRoutes` parameter when you instantiate your sub-router.  

For example:

```
var mySubRouteInstance = new BooksRouter("books", {createTrailingSlashRoutes: true));
```

Using the examples above, a URL of either `http://yourserver.org/books/search` or `http://yourserver.org/books/search/` would fire the `searchBooks()` callback.

## Testing

The `spec` directory in the repo contains a suite of test specs.  To run them, start a web server in the project directory, then point your browser to the `spec` directory.

The test specs can also be run online [here](http://modeln.github.com/backbone.subroute/spec/).
